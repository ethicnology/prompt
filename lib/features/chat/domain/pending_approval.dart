/// Full detail of one pending, human-actionable approval for the active
/// session: a tool-call permission (`bash`, `edit`, `webfetch`, ...), or a
/// set of questions the agent's `question` tool is asking.
///
/// This is deliberately a much richer type than [SessionBlockReason] (see
/// `session_block_reason.dart`): it exists only to render the accessible
/// approval dock/sheet a human must act on. It never gates the queue by
/// itself — dispatch stays governed by [SessionBlockReason] and the
/// authoritative `session.status`/`session.idle` rule, exactly as before
/// this type existed.
///
/// A [PendingApproval] is reduced only from a live SSE event
/// (`permission.updated` or `question.asked`) received while a session is
/// activated; it is never fetched, reconciled, or cached beyond that
/// activation, and it is never written to Drift, a log, or a diagnostic
/// export. [PendingPermissionApproval.title] and every [QuestionPrompt]
/// field may describe a sensitive command, path, or question the agent
/// wants answered — that sensitivity is exactly why this type exists (so a
/// human can actually review it), but it is also exactly why a caller must
/// only ever render it to that human, never log or persist it.
