/// Orchestrates when Prompt's durable per-session queue may dispatch a
/// prompt to OpenCode.
///
/// This is deliberately a use case, not a repository: it composes
/// [QueuePromptsRepository] (the durable queue), [ChatRepository]
/// (`sendPrompt`/`abortSession`/`sessionStatus`), [OpenCodeEventService]
/// (the live SSE feed), and the pure conversation reducer. No individual
/// repository owns this coordination on its own.
///
/// Rules this type enforces:
/// - Exactly one session is coordinated at a time ("one active session
///   scope"); activating a new session tears down the previous one first.
/// - A `sending` prompt found persisted at activation is reconciled to
///   `paused`/`submissionUnknown` before anything else happens, because a
///   prior send's outcome is unknown after a restart or reactivation.
/// - The queue head only dispatches once the session's authoritative
///   status is idle and no prompt in the session is paused with
///   `submissionUnknown`; a normal enqueue never triggers an abort.
/// - `sendNow` explicitly aborts the active generation, then waits for the
///   session to settle idle before dispatching the chosen prompt.
/// - A `prompt_async` success (`204`) is definitive acceptance and marks the
///   prompt `acknowledged`; any other outcome is transport-uncertain and
///   moves the prompt to `paused`/`submissionUnknown` instead of retrying.
/// - A `permission.updated` SSE event pauses every currently `queued`
///   prompt in the active session with `permissionPending`/
///   `questionPending` and blocks all dispatch. This is a foundation only:
///   no approval UI exists yet, so `permission.replied` is never reduced or
///   acted on here. The block is lifted only when a fresh, authoritative
///   `session.status`/`session.idle` event arrives, at which point every
///   prompt this coordinator paused for that reason (and only those) moves
///   back to `queued`.
/// - Unrelated SSE events are ignored; only session status/idle updates
///   gate the queue.
/// - Nothing here logs prompt text, a permission's title/pattern/metadata,
///   or raw failure detail.
///
/// ## Lifecycle-aware reconnect
///
/// A dropped SSE connection is never silently discarded. [notifyAppInactive]
/// and [notifyAppForeground] let the app's lifecycle owner (the composition
/// root observing `AppLifecycleState`) drive this coordinator explicitly:
///
/// - Going inactive cancels the live SSE subscription and any pending
///   reconnect timer immediately; no reconnect is attempted while the app
///   is backgrounded, matching this app's battery/data budget.
/// - Returning to the foreground reconnects immediately if a session is
///   still active.
/// - An unexpected drop while foreground (a transport error, or the
///   stream simply ending) schedules a bounded exponential-backoff-with-
///   jitter reconnect via [backoffPolicy], surfaced on [connectionState] as
///   [SseReconnecting]. Retrying stops, surfaced as [SseDisconnected], once
///   [backoffPolicy] no longer permits another attempt.
/// - Every reconnect (as opposed to the very first connection of an
///   [activate] call, which trusts the status [activate] already fetched
///   moments before) re-fetches the session's authoritative status before
///   trusting anything from the new connection; [connectionState] reports
///   [SseReconciling] for that whole window. [_maybeDispatch] never
///   dispatches unless [connectionState] is [SseConnected], so queued
///   prompts never send against a connection whose missed events have not
///   yet been reconciled.
